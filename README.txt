Death God ReadMe

Okay here's the deal: I've put a shitton of time into this engine,
but I'm never going to make a dime on it anyway so it's free for
anyone to use all they want, in any way that they want.

HOWEVER, please please please if you add anything to it
all, send the changes back to me, and then you can also benefit from
any improvements I make since there will only be one version of the
engine :)

Also, please don't take credit for my work. I will be sad. :(

 ==========================================================================
 To run the game, either run the "run_game.sh" bash script, or navigate 
 into the "src" folder and run "main.py".
 
 To change the player name, look no further than src/settings.py

By the way, it's called "Death God" because the game I want to
eventually make with it is a Bleach-based rogue-like.
