# Death God

PyGame Rogue-like engine with genetic AI algorithm tester.

This was originally a side project in college because I wanted to
learn Python and I was obsessed with the anime *Bleach*,
and desperately wanted a Roguelike about it to exist.
Later on, I needed to complete an assignment for an AI elective
class, and spawned a bunch of frogs and gave them genetically
generated decision trees. (Loosely, as I never developed a way to
visualize the trees. The frogs do *seem* to get better at killing
the player as the game goes on, however.)
