# Death God

PyGame Roguelike engine with genetic AI algorithm tester.
(Student project.)

## Background

This was originally a side project in college because I wanted to
learn Python and I was obsessed with the anime *Bleach*,
and desperately wanted a Roguelike about it to exist. Later, I
needed to complete an assignment for an AI elective class and
spawned a bunch of frogs and gave them genetically generated decision
trees. (Loosely, as I never developed a way to visualize the trees.
The frogs do *seem* to get better at killing the player as the game
goes on, however.)

Because this was a college project I worked on over ten years ago, I
have not made any changes to substandard style or engineering choices.
I leave judgment in the hands of the reader. :) I provide it here for
three reasons:

1. Fun.
2. To demonstrate that I know Python.
3. I enjoy hacking on it occasionally to keep it working on modern OSes.
